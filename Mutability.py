# Mutability = changeable, for flexible data; For Example a list, dictionary,
# Immutability = Unchangeable, for secure data; For Example a tuple, ints, floats, booleans

# in dictionaries the keys are immuatble while the values are mutable
# if keys were mutable there would be no consistency organization
# or when you are looking for the index you use an integer which is immutable
